# ¡Hello! 👋 💫

I am an iOS Developer focused on building real-world mobile applications, with experience delivering complete products from design to App Store publication.

I have developed and published apps featuring StoreKit monetization, REST API integration, secure authentication using Keychain, and MVVM architecture. I also have experience working with backend development using Vapor and PostgreSQL, as well as integrating AI-powered features into mobile applications.

In addition, I have hands-on experience in Android development using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, applying MVVM architecture, dependency injection with Dagger Hilt, API consumption with Retrofit, and local persistence with Room.

With a background in UI/UX design, I build applications that combine solid architecture, performance, and a polished user experience.

I am currently seeking my first professional opportunity to contribute to a development team, grow in a collaborative environment, and continue evolving as a Mobile Engineer.
